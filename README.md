# 270 MATH Linear Algebra Project: Software Renderer

Our software renderer takes any number of triangles in 3D space and transforms and projects them onto 2D space. Specifically, for our project, we take twelve 
triangles in the orientation of a cube in 3 dimensional space and transform and project them onto screen space while having the cube move and rotate from 
side-to-side across the screen. Our project involves extensive use of matrix multiplication and affine transformations to serve as an application of the 
various linear algebra concepts we have learned inside and outside of class.

## Requirements 



## Installation

We recommend installing the Rust programming language using rustup; this will install both Rust and Cargo (the Rust package manager). To run our software, we 
used Visual Studio Code.
